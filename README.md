This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a Order Stat CSV. The Order Stat CSV allows WordPress admin users to add their settings for a plugin. 

You can use this skeleton to add a Order Stat CSV to your plugin. This plugin does the following:
- Adds an admin menu item to the left sidebar in the WordPress admin dashboard along with a submenu item including your Order Stat CSV
- Creates a Order Stat CSV that includes a form
- Saves that form to the database
- Makes sure the settings form fields are pre-populated if it has already been filled out

The Order Stat CSV plugin is using the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate framework](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) and we used [WWPB.me](https://wppb.me/) to generate a version with the settings-page namespaces.
