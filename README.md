This is a simple WordPress plugin that creates a Woorder CSV. The Woorder CSV allows WordPress admin users to add their settings for a plugin. 

This plugin does the following:
- Adds an admin menu item to the left sidebar in the WordPress admin dashboard along with a submenu item including your Woorder CSV
- Creates a Export CSV button on WooCommerce Order page
- Exports the Woo Commerce orders into CSV format for download
- Makes sure the settings form fields are pre-populated if it has already been filled out

Check out our [blog post](https://blog.wplauncher.com/create-wordpress-plugin-settings-page/) to get step by step instructions on [how to add a Woorder CSV to your WordPress plugin](https://blog.wplauncher.com/create-wordpress-plugin-settings-page/). The Woorder CSV plugin is using the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate framework](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) and we used [WWPB.me](https://wppb.me/) to generate a version with the settings-page namespaces.
